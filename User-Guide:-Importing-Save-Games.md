### PSP: Importing from the memory stick to OpenEMU

1. Connect the PSP to your Mac and browse to `MEMORY STICK/PSP/SAVEDATA`

2. Each save file is present in a folder. These folders have a unique name scheme. In order to find your specific games, you may want to browse the individual folders and look at the icons. Copy the folders you want.

3. Go to `~/Library/Application Support/OpenEmu/PPSSPP/PSP/SAVEDATA/`. Paste the folders here.

4. Load your game from OpenEmu as usual. When the game asks to load save file, you should now be able to select you original save files.
