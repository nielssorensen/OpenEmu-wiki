# Things to do

## Upcoming release

* Unable to delete save states properly, Issue #7


## OpenEmu.next

Revamp UI as per Mucx's mockups. Some issues solved along the way:

* No low battery notification in full screen (#6)

## Wishlist

* Save state portability (i.e. allowing save states to work between emulators)
* TAS front end, to work on any emulator
* Global cheat system
* Mouse/Lightgun support (already mostly there)
