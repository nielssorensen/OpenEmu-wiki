### Overview

* Only the [latest version](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/releases/latest) of OpenEmu is supported.
* OpenEmu running on non-Apple hardware aka "Hackintosh" is strictly unsupported.
* Usage of [experimental and WIP](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/Console---Core-Plugin-Status-&-Wishlist) core ports are strictly unsupported and have no ETA.
* Read the [User guide](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide) first &mdash;
 it may address your question or problem.

### Reporting Issues and Required Information

* Search the [issues](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues?q=is%3Aissue) before opening a new one.
* Do not open a duplicate issue if one or similar already exists. You can reply in closed issues, unless locked.
* Do not comment with useless "+1", "üëç", "me too", "bump" or "any update?" in issues &mdash; only add useful information.
* Do not follow tutorials found on YouTube as they are often wrong.
* Do not post links or refer to copyright infringing ROM download sites.
* Be as detailed and specific as possible, with exact steps to replicate a problem. Learn more [here](http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) and [here](https://www.mikeash.com/getting_answers.html).
* Include [Console and crash logs](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/Troubleshooting:-Console-and-crash-reports), macOS and OpenEmu version, hardware information, ROM/game filenames, etc.

### Common Problems

* If keyboard and/or gamepad are not working, read the guide on [input troubleshooting](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/Troubleshooting:-Input-problems) for a solution.
* Closely follow the [CD and M3U guide](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide:-CD-based-games) for importing CD-based games &mdash; no additional help beyond the guides will be offered.
* NDS games (especially Pokemon) may have unsolvable problems related to AP patches or DeSmuME's JIT dynarec. Alternatively, try standalone DeSmuME that has the JIT dynarec off by default which may improve compatibility.
* Arcade/MAME is unsupported because it is an experimental core port and has inherent usability and maintainability issues. It is recommended to use the official [standalone](http://bamf2048.github.io/sdl_mame_tut/) version and to read this helpful [MAME ROMs tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20180101211010/https://choccyhobnob.com/mame/demystifying-mame-roms/).
* Cheat code support is not available for all systems, as noted in the [cheat codes](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide:-Cheat-codes) guide.
